quantyOfDaily = float(input("Enter quanty of daily: "))

if typeOfDaily.upper()[0] == "S":
    print(f"Your value of daily is : {255,50 * quantyOfDaily}")
elif typeOfDaily.upper()[0] == "D":
    print(f"Your value of daily is : {305,50 * quantyOfDaily}")
elif typeOfDaily.upper()[0] == "T":
    print(f"Your value of daily is {360,50}")
